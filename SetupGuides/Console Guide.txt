Need:

Modded Nintendo Switch with Homebrew
Atmosphere
Xenoblade 2 Version 2.1.0 with all DLC
microSD card (16 GB?)
NXDumpTool
Xenoblade2Set
Python 3.11

Adapted from: https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13815

An exFAT-formatted microSD card is recommended; FAT32 seems to mess stuff up.

Process:

1. Use NXDumpTool to dump XC2's RomFS.
2. Put your microSD card into your computer, and locate "bf2.ard" and "bf2.arh"; those are the only two important files. Everything else in the dump can be safely deleted.
3. Download Xenoblade2Set from (https://gbatemp.net/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-2-graphics-settings.529436/), and extract its contents.
4. (is this needed?) Delete anything inside the "modified" folder.
5. Copy bf2.ard and bf2.arh to the Xenoblade2Set folder, and run "quickbms_4gb_files.exe".
6. It will ask for a "bms script"; select Xenoblade2ard.bms. It will then ask for "archives/files"; select bf2.arh. For "output folder", go into the empty "modified" folder and press "Save". The files should extract, it may take a bit.
7. There should now be a new "bdat" folder inside "modified"; This is the folder that the randomizer program needs to target as the input folder. The output folder should be /atmosphere/contents/0100E95004039001/romfs/bdat on your microSD card. (You might need to create a new folder in romfs/bdat, called "gb". Put nothing inside this folder for now, the randomizer will add the required files to it).
8. Use the randomizer program to randomize the contents of the game.
9. Put your microSD card back into your Switch, use Atmosphere and Homebrew to launch the game. Pressing L bypasses the active patches, so if you wish to play the vanilla game again, you can do so in this way.
