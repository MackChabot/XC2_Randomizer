Make option sliders in my UI for the in game option sliders

Clean up code make readable and fast

Fix cosmetics

Make Readme

Mutually Exclusive Widgets (Fixes Skill Tree Options Alex+Mine)
  
Scroll bars generates with loops not manually

Figure out conflict between Alex wanted to load a save and settings defaults that the save will then overwrite

Starting Accessories (Probably just make this remove starting accesories who cares what you get initially)

NPC Rando (Eventually want npcs to actually exist there not just the model (actor swap))

Menu Colors (Get working in a not ugly way)
